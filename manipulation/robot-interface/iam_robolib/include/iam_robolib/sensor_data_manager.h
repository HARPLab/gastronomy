/**
 * This class will try to read the sensor data from shared memory and populate the appropriate MessageProto. For each
 * class  This class tries to acquire the lock to read the sensor data part of shared memory. If successful, it writes
 * the data into shared memory, else if it cannot acquire the lock it does not do anything.
 *
 * The protocol for reading data to the shared memory is the following. Note that the shared memory is of type
 * unsigned int (uint_8) i.e. raw bytes.
 *
 * 1) First byte of the shared memory is read and should be 1 (indicating a new message). If the first byte is 0 do not
 *    read the message.
 *
 * 2) The second byte is the type of shared memory message type. This should be used to verify if the right
 *    message is being read by the iam-robolib library running on control-PC. This is arbitrarily set for now.
 *    More importantly, this is just a single byte for now so the type value should lie between 0 and 255.
 *
 * 3) In the next 4 bytes (i.e. byte 2 to 6) we read the size of the sensor data message that was written. We read
 *    the lowest byte (2) as the least significant byte of the integer size and so on.
 *
 * 4) From byte 6 onwards we use the protobuf library to parse the raw proto data into a Protobuf message.
