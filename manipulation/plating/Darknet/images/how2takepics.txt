For taking pictures with the Azure Kinect manually:
1) run:
    roslaunch azure_kinect_ros_driver driver.launch
   - need to download this from the azure kinect ros git
2) In another terminal run:
    rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
3) From the drop down menu, select camera type and begin saving the
images. Before you run this command go to the directory where you want
to save the images. It saves a lot of time when saving.
