### Build Instructions
To add additional classification information to visualizations, replace the files "Visualizer.cpp" and "Visualizer.h" in the directory OpenFace/lib/local/Utilities/ with the ones included here.

The folder HRI_Classifier can be added to OpenFace/exe to create a classification-specific image processing script, then follow normal build instructions for OpenFace.
