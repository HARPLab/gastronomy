# Data Organization in pytorch-dense-correspondence

The purpose of this doc is to describe the organization for how data logs are stored, their format, directory structure, etc.

## Highest level directory structure

At the highest level we use this directory identifier to identify where data is located:

```
pdc/
```

Most data will live in data logs in this location:

```
pdc/
    logs_proto/
```

Within `logs_proto`, there is one directory for each RGBD video log and associated data.

These logs have unique names which correspond to the year, month, day, hour, minute, second they were created (`YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss`).  For example they 
might be located at:

```
pdc/
    logs_proto/
        2018-04-06-11-34-13/
        2018-04-06-11-37-44/
        2018-04-03-19-56-58/
```

## Log directories

A "log" for our purposes is the folder and all of the data inside of it.  Inside each log are two sub-directories, `raw`, and `processed`:


```
pdc/
    logs_proto/
        2018-04-06-11-34-13/
            raw/
            processed/
```

There are a couple reasons for having separate `raw/` and `processed/` subdirectories:

1. Having separate `raw/` and `processed/` subdirectories makes it very easy to:
    - Copy only `processed` data, no raw data, to different locations for training + testing
    - Easily `rm -rf ./processed` or even `rm -rf ./logs_proto/*/processed` in order for us iterate and re-do how we are taking raw data
  and processing it
2. There is a large difference, due to the downsampling that we do the data, in their sizes:
    - Raw data of a typical log is, for example at this time of writing, 5.2 GB
    - Processed and downsampled data for downstream training is, for example at this time of writing, only 115 MB
    
## Data within a log

Within these two folders, for each log, at this time of writing we have the following files:

```
pdc/
    logs_proto/
        2018-04-06-11-34-13/
            raw/
                fusion_2018-04-06-11-34-13.bag
            processed/
                fusion_mesh.ply
                fusion_pointcloud.ply
                tsdf.bin
                images/
                image_masks/
                rendered_images/
```

The above components are as follows.  Note that these components are generated by different components
of the data processing pipeline.  More on how this data processing pipeline fits together is described in 
[data_pipeline.md](https://github.com/peteflorence/pytorch-dense-correspondence/blob/master/doc/data_pipeline.md)

| Subdirectory | Item | Description | Generated by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `raw/` | `fusion_YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss.bag` | Raw rosbag of all data needed for fusion.  The redundant date is a double check that logs are in the right place. | `spartan` |
| `processed/` | `fusion_mesh.ply` | Mesh of the scene generated from tsdf-fusion, then marching cubes | `spartan` |
| `processed/` | `fusion_pointcloud.ply` | Pointcloud of the scene generated from tsdf-fusion | `tsdf-fusion` (subrepo of `spartan`) |
| `processed/` | `tsdf.bin` | TSDF scene generated from tsdf-fusion | `tsdf-fusion` (subrepo of `spartan`) |
| `processed/` | `images/`  | sub-directory of extracted `images` and other metadata | `spartan` |
| `processed/` | `image_masks/`  | masks of objects of interest | `pytorch-dense-correspondence` |
| `processed/` | `rendered_images/`  | rendered depth images against the fused scene mesh | `pytorch-dense-correspondence` |
 

## Data within image folders

Within the image folders we have the following layout, which completes the layout of a log folder structure:

```
pdc/
    logs_proto/
        2018-04-06-11-34-13/
            raw/
                fusion_2018-04-06-11-34-13.bag
            processed/
                fusion_mesh.ply
                fusion_pointcloud.ply
                tsdf.bin
                images/
                    000000_rgb.png
                    000000_depth.png
                    ...
                    002553_rgb.png
                    002553_depth.png
                    ...
                    camera_info.yaml
                    pose_data.yaml
                image_masks/
                    000000_mask.png
                    000000_visible_mask.png
                    ...
                    002553_mask.png
                    002553_visible_mask.png
                rendered_images/
                    000000_depth.png
                    000000_depth_cropped.png
                    ...
                    002553_depth.png
                    002553_depth_cropped.png
```

Note that images that remain in `processed/` data have **already been downsampled**, and so not every number exists, i.e. `000000_rgb.png`, then `000017_rgb.png`.  All original images exist, however, in the original rosbag within `raw/`.

Notes on the data within image folders serve different purposes and are generated from different components as follows:

| Subdirectory | Item | Description | Generated by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `processed/images/` | `######_rgb.png` | Raw RGB image. | `spartan` |
| `processed/images/` | `######_depth.png` | "Raw" depth image. **Note that this has been rectified and registered to be in the frame of the RGB image** | `spartan` |
| `processed/images/` | `camera_info.yaml` | Camera intrinsics for the rgbd camera (rectification and color-depth registration has already happened, so only the intrinsics matrix is needed at this point in the pipeline). | `spartan` |
| `processed/images/` | `pose_data.yaml` | Pose of the camera in *robot base frame* as calculated from forward kinematics of the 7-dof robot arm.  | `spartan` |
| `processed/image_masks/` | `######_mask.png` | Mask of objects of interest, with 0 as background | change detection code inside `pytorch-dense-correspondence` |
| `processed/image_masks/` | `######_visible_mask.png` | Masked parts are made to look white, so are easily human-readable | change detection code inside `pytorch-dense-correspondence` |
| `processed/rendered_images/` | `######_depth.png` | Rendered depth image against the full fused mesh of the scene | change detection code inside `pytorch-dense-correspondence` |
| `processed/rendered_images/` | `######_depth_cropped.png` | Rendered depth image against the change-detected part of the fused mesh of the scene | change detection code inside `pytorch-dense-correspondence` |
