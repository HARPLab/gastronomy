## Remote workflow

Here are some tips on remote working on this repo over ssh / etc.

#### 1. Ssh in and access already-running container
If you already have a container running on a machine, but want to ssh in, you can still enter the already-running container:

```
docker exec -it pytorch-container bash
```

Where `pytorch-container` is the name of the container as for example displayed form `docker ps`.

#### 2. Find already-running notebook tokens

If you have a notebook running inside that container, once in the container you can figure out the notebook's token by:

```
jupyter notebook list
```

Which will for example give you:

```
Currently running servers:
http://0.0.0.0:8888/?token=a54c73014d7bcd57ea8f6c8e4f0803fb6d97d338d932de87 :: /home/peteflo/code
```

#### 3. Jump into already-running notebook session 
You can then hop into your previously-started notebook session by entering in the IP in your remote browser:

```
http://replace.with.actual.ip:8888/?token=a54c73014d7bcd57ea8f6c8e4f0803fb6d97d338d932de87
```

#### 4. Visualizing tensorboard that is running on remote machine

There are just 3 steps. See this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37987839/how-can-i-run-tensorboard-on-a-remote-server/40413202?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) for the complete explanation.

1. Setup forwarding of port `6006` on remote machine to `16006` on your local machine.

```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:16006:localhost:6006 <user@remote>
```

2. Launch tensorboard locally on the host machine. Note that I do this outside of a docker container by simply navigating to the directory I want and then running `tensorboard --logdir=$(pwd)`.

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:16006` in your browser.
