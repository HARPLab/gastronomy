todo:
important:
	sometimes feat1x1 comes out to be all 0s which results in NaN
	temporarily fixed by adding epsilon but need to find a better solution
	maybe only sample those which are occupied and not all

done:
add checkpoint mechanism to only save recent checkpoints and not all of them
add path.yaml for handling hostname
get rid of validXs and add new ones
