todo:
	retrieval res in expectation is already fast! dont waste time!!
	train pair in maximization also we can check if we can make it fast!!
	make retrieval res in maximiaztion step batch wise to save compute!!!

	#once all bugs fixed

	make the pool multi gpu .. put it on a different gpu maybe!!!!
	make all similarity convolution operations with no grad all before model.train()!!!
	
doing:

	add visualization for hard mining!!
done:
	fix bugs negative sampling!!!!

	start with random initialization use ground truth anontations and remove the update in pool. and  overfit the model!!!!
