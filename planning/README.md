# Planning in grid-world

This is a software package for running the task-switching code on a grid-world restaurant simulation.

# vrep simulation 

This a software package for creating a restaurant environment in VREP simulator. In future work, we plan to integrate the task-switching code and the restaurant simulation to demonstrate the task-switching algorithms on a simulated robot.
