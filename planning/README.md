# Planning

This is a software package for robot planning in a restaurant setting. The details of the planner and the restaurant model is in [1].

# VREP simulation 

This a software package for creating a restaurant environment in VREP simulator. In future work, we plan to integrate the task-switching code and the restaurant simulation to demonstrate the task-switching algorithms on a simulated robot.
